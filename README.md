# PythonLearning
This is all of the projects I've built while going through the 2022 Complete Python Bootcamp course from Udemy.
This repo is divided into 3 folders, one for practice scripts, ending in a .py file entension,
one for practice Jupyter Notebooks, ending in a .ipynb file extension, and one for projects, ending in whatever file entension the project calls for.
